# simplified-azure-rm-iaas-provisioning
## Background
simplified-azure-rm-iaas-provisioning provides an alternative to [Azure Resource Manager templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-authoring-templates/) for provisioning Azure IaaS services.
This approach has a very limited scope and is only meant to be used for quick and consistent vm provisioning.
## Usage
Run the script `Provision.ps1` to generate a configuration file. It should be pretty self explanatory.
